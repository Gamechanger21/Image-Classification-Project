# Image Classification Using Hand-Crafted Features, Neural Networks, and CNNs

This project compares three image classification methods: hand-crafted features + SVM, simple neural networks, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on the TinyImageNet100 dataset (15 selected classes). It was developed as part of the ECS8053 ‚Äì Computer Vision coursework.

## üìä Methods Implemented

### 1. Hand-Crafted Features + SVM
- ORB + Bag of Words
- SIFT + Bag of Words
- ORB + Fisher Vector
- SIFT + Fisher Vector

### 2. Neural Networks
- Fully connected layers with ReLU, batch normalization, and dropout.

### 3. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Baseline CNN with grayscale input
- Advanced CNN with data augmentation and color input
